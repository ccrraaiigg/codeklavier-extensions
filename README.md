# codeklavier-extensions
Codeklavier &amp; Friends (code output targeting specific languages or DSLs or systems)

### This repository is a collection of .ini files to boot the codeklavier to be able to interact with other platforms.

The .ini files allow to boot the Codeklavier with spacial mappings that allow it to interact with different systems. Currently, the following
extensions are being developed:

- Caffeine.js (by Craig Latta)
- Augmented Reality / Unity (by Patrick Borgeat)
- Yamaha Disklavier (by Narcode)
- Hybrid (by Narcode)
- Hydra (by Olivia Jack)
- Mercury (by Timo Hoogland)
- NieuwBallet (by Joana Chicau)

# How does it work
When booting the codeklavier through the command line use the option -i <name_of_the_ini_file> syntax. For example
`.\codeklavier -i ckar.ini`
